/* Section: FANN Datatypes

   The two main datatypes used in the fann library are <struct fann>, 
   which represents an artificial neural network, and <struct fann_train_data>,
   which represents training data.
 */


/* Type: fann_type
   fann_type is the type used for the weights, inputs and outputs of the neural network.
   
	fann_type is defined as a:
	float - if you include fann.h or floatfann.h
	double - if you include doublefann.h
	int - if you include fixedfann.h (please be aware that fixed point usage is 
			only to be used during execution, and not during training).

/* Enum: fann_train_enum
	The Training algorithms used when training on <struct fann_train_data> with functions like
	<fann_train_on_data> or <fann_train_on_file>. The incremental training alters the weights
	after each time it is presented an input pattern, while batch only alters the weights once after
	it has been presented to all the patterns.

	FANN_TRAIN_INCREMENTAL -  Standard backpropagation algorithm, where the weights are 
		updated after each training pattern. This means that the weights are updated many 
		times during a single epoch. For this reason some problems will train very fast with 
		this algorithm, while other more advanced problems will not train very well.
	FANN_TRAIN_BATCH -  Standard backpropagation algorithm, where the weights are updated after 
		calculating the mean square error for the whole training set. This means that the weights 
		are only updated once during an epoch. For this reason some problems will train slower with 
		this algorithm. But since the mean square error is calculated more correctly than in 
		incremental training, some problems will reach better solutions with this algorithm.
	FANN_TRAIN_RPROP - A more advanced batch training algorithm which achieves good results 
		for many problems. The RPROP training algorithm is adaptive, and does therefore not 
		use the learning_rate. Some other parameters can however be set to change the way the 
		RPROP algorithm works, but it is only recommended for users with insight in how the RPROP 
		training algorithm works. The RPROP training algorithm is described by 
		[Riedmiller and Braun, 1993], but the actual learning algorithm used here is the 
		iRPROP- training algorithm which is described by [Igel and Husken, 2000] which 
		is a variant of the standard RPROP training algorithm.
	FANN_TRAIN_QUICKPROP - A more advanced batch training algorithm which achieves good results 
		for many problems. The quickprop training algorithm uses the learning_rate parameter 
		along with other more advanced parameters, but it is only recommended to change these 
		advanced parameters, for users with insight in how the quickprop training algorithm works.
		The quickprop training algorithm is described by [Fahlman, 1988].
